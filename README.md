2. Download the SpotSense SDK
    Download the SpotSenseSDK via GitHub or dependency by doing the following
    
```groovy
dependencies {
    ...
     implementation 'com.spotsenseio:spotsense:1.0.1'
    ...
}
```
   
    
    
3. `import spotsense` and initialize SpotSense with Client ID and Secret from the Dashboard
```java
import com.spotsense.interfaces.GetSpotSenseData;
import com.spotsense.utils.spotSenseGeofencing.SpotSense;


SpotSense spotSense = new SpotSense(this, "Replace with your client id", "Replace with your client Secret", new GetSpotSenseData() {
            @Override
            public void getSpotSenseGeofencingData(String GeofenceTransactions, String geofenceName) {

            }

            @Override
            public void getSpotSenseBeaconData(String beaconTransactions, String beaconName) {

            }
});
